Description: ==========
        NeuroTools
        ==========
        
        NeuroTools is a collection of tools for representing and analyzing
        neuroscientific data.
        
        NeuroTools is written in Python, and works best with PyNN, or one of the growing
        list of simulation engines with a Python front-end such as NEURON, NEST, PCSIM,
        FACETS Neuromorphic VLSI, Brian, MOOSE/GENESIS, Neurospaces/GENESIS. NeuroTools
        provides modules to facilitate simulation setup, parameterization and
        instrumentation, and data management, analysis and visualization. The
        data-related tools are equally suited to analysis of experimental data, although
        that is not the primary motivation for their development.
        
        NeuroTools aims to:
        
        1. increase the productivity of individual modellers by automating, simplifying,
           and establishing best-practices for common tasks,
        
        2. increase the productivity of the neuroscience modelling community by reducing
           the amount of code duplication across simulation communities,
        
        3. increase the reliability of data analysis tools leveraging Linus's law:
           "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."

        This code is considered to be mature and will not evolve - we will  only focus on bug fixes.
        
        Development of a new analysis library takes place @ https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/elephant
