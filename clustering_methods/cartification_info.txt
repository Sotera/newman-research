Included here is wrapper for cartification clustering

From project page:
Input

CartiClus accepts parameters as command line arguments in a specified order. If the optional parameters are omitted, their default values will be used instead.
data-file: Path to the multi dimensional datafile that will be cartified. Please find the properties of the data file below.
k: Parameter for the k nearest neighbors.
minsup: Minimum support count for the mining. This is the actual count not a percentage.
numOfdimensions: The number of dimensions in the data-file.
cartLog: (optional) Direct the output of the mining step instead of /dev/null
outputfile: (optional) Direct output to this file instead of standart output

About data file:

it includes space separated real values,
each row represents an instance,
each column represents an feature/dimension,
does not include a(ny) header row(s),
all instances have the same number of features,
there are no missing values,
real values should be in the USA locale (use . as decimal separator)

Output

CartiClus outputs the found clusters to the standard output. Each line of output represents a subspace cluster. Output format:
Subspaces for cluster [Size of cluster] Objects of the cluster
For example, 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 [10] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 means a cluster is detected at 1st, 2nd and 6th subspaces and it has '10' objects, i.e., 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
